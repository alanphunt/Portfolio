<p>Hey, my name's Alan Hunt and this is my website. This site is under
	construction as I add new content, so it's currently pretty bare- bear
	with me.</p>


<p>I'm a 26-year-old undergrad at Illinois State University studying
	Information Systems with a sequence in Web Application Development and
	a minor in Business Administration.</p>

<p>
	Some of my hobbies include: <br>Coding <br>Coffee <br>Cattlestar
	Galactica
</p>

<p>Welcome to the new design of my website! The old layout was started
	as a midterm project in an introduction to web development class and
	this one was started as an assignment for an introduction to ASP.NET
	class. The goal for this redesign was to simplify the color scheme and
	layout, create more white space for a modern feel, and make the code
	more efficient for editing, appending, and responsiveness.</p>


<p>I feel I've got the layout framework and styling solidified but I'm
	going to be adding a ton of features like blog interactivity throughout
	the semester as I dig into Javascript, PHP, and C# more, so stay tuned.
</p>

<p>In the mean time, read the blog, check the photographs, and listen to
	the music I've made over the years and reach out to me.</p>

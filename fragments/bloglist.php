<p>Sure, Craigslist came along and certainly destroyed the revenue newspapers generated selling ad space, but even those that have ran others out of business eventually get ran out themselves if they don't keep up, so now Craigslist is on its way out.</p>

<p>
When I first started at Altman's, the job was mostly digital marketing (in a very loose sense). The owners always told me \"list this crap on Cragslist\" and so I did. Did that work? Who knows, Craigslist doesn't offer any metrics. Fast forward a handful of months, I started utilizing Facebook Marketplace and groups like \"Craigslist of Bloomington/Normal\" to advertise promotional events around the store. Thousands upon thousands of people saw the ads and our Facebook page was getting hundreds of hits; obviously successful and had a great return for the invest of $0. I knew this because Facebook gives you analytics on your posts and page visits! Very handy! </p>

<p>
A couple weeks of heavy posting to my groups and Marketplace and there was a noticeable increase in the traffic to the store, so much so that my bosses were actually <em>considering</em> hiring more people. This is definitely a good problem to have, but my bosses don't actually want to hire, and deal with, more people, so they didn't. That's besides the point. 
</p>

<p>
The point is that \"advertising\" on Facebook Marketplace and through various buy/sell groups worked and I had the numbers to back it up. I couldn't say the same about Craigslist.
</p>

<p>
I still post things on Craigslist just to be able to say to my bosses that I did, and given, I still want Altman's to be accessible no matter what the platform, but since this new-found success on Marketplace I definitely don't find myself on Craigslist hardly ever anymore.
</p>

<p>
Let's go down the list and see why Craigslist is now dead in the water.
</p>

<p class=\"blockquote\">
The simplicity of Craigslist was once an advantage, but has now become a bullet hole in their foot.
</p>
<p>
Craigslist was/is reminiscent of the web before cascading style sheets (CSS), and it's extremely easy to navigate. I'd be willing to bet the majority demographic is the 44+ age range. There are no ads cluttering your viewport, no graphics or symbolism to make you guess what might be the nav menu, just good ol' links and categories. This was great, but now it's just plain dated. These styles of websites are seen as vastly unprofessional and elementary with the web languages we have available today. Craigslist doesn't require any purposeful color schemes or layouts persay, but it's hard to build consumer trust when it seems like you don't care to invest into the presentation of your platform- which happens to solely be a website. 
</p>

<p>
With the simplistic presentation comes the simplistic (or non-existant) features. <p class=\"blockquote\">The age-old dillemma with buying/selling on Craigslist is the fact that you don't know who's on the other end of the computer.</p> Craigslist didn't have to become a social media platform like Facebook to counteract this drawback, where everyone has a profile with personal information and pictures, but even a buyer/seller rating system would've helped ease concerns and build trust. To post an item on Craigslist you have to have an account, it would be trivial to code in a rating system for each profile. With Facebook, you're posting an item from your profile which has your information and a picture of yourself, so buyers know exactly who they're dealing with and would have less concerns meeting in person to perform the exchange. This is ultimately where Craigslist is
losing. Not to mention, Craigslist just started charging for business postings. If there's more revenue coming in, can't you guys hire a designer?
</p>

<p>
Facebook's marketshare has been in a completely different category and is wildly bigger than Craigslist, but this has certainly helped with Facebook crossing into the personal listings realm. Everyone's already on Facebook, why go to a different platform to post an item for sale? It's a one stop shop! Facebook's search feature is way more precise, their learning algorithm exists, and the layout of the items and category listings is just as easy as Craigslist but also much more intuitive. Sorry Craigslist.
</p>

<p>
I'll get to wrapping up. Craigslist is toast. They haven't even tried to compete and I'm pretty sure they're okay with that. They weren't in it to make money, but you're not going to be in it at all if you don't at least try. Facebook offers the familiarity of their platform and the expertise of their company, so you know you're getting cutting edge features. No Facebook did not pay me to write this, that would be cool.
